## Alert Detail



### [ Cookie No HttpOnly Flag ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10010/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.

### [ Insufficient Site Isolation Against Spectre Vulnerability ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

Instances: 11

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header to 'same-origin' for all web pages.
'same-site' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.
If resources must be shared, set the header to 'cross-origin'.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-resource-policy).

### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (High)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/volleyball/login/
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=username
userValue=ZAP
passwordParam=password
referer=http://host.docker.internal:8000/volleyball/login/
csrfToken=csrfmiddlewaretoken`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

### [ Modern Web Application ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10109/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The application appears to be a modern web application. If you need to explore it automatically then the Ajax Spider may well be more effective than the standard one.

* URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/volleyball/checkout/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
  * Other Info: `No links have been found while there are scripts, which is an indication that this is a modern web application.`

### [ Non-Storable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.

* URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/volleyball/account/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/volleyball/checkout/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/volleyball/home/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://host.docker.internal:8000/volleyball/logout/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `302`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 5

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).

### [ Session Management Response Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10112/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The given response has been identified as containing a session management token. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of header tokens that can be used in the Header Based Session Management Method. If the request is in a context which has a Session Management Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the session management to use the tokens identified.

### [ Storable and Cacheable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`

Instances: 7

### Solution

Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.
